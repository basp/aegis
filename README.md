# Aegis
**Aegis** is a modern toolkit for implementing **geographic information systems** that is
written from the ground up for .NET that tries to be low on dependencies and faithful to
established standards.

The interface is heavily inspired by the fabulous **GDAL** toolkit but the implementation
is independent and also **Aegis** is in a lot of cases relaxed and in other cases a lot 
more restricted than **GDAL** because it doesn't try to do everything.

What it **does** try to do however is to guide you in the right direction when you're
wring GIS related software.
